# 🌍 Global Happiness Index Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Global Happiness Index**, which ranks countries worldwide by their reported happiness levels based on factors like GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

I used **Excel** to structure the Database and join tables from multiple years

I used **Python** for data cleaning, processing, and visualizations to better understand:
- How happiness scores are distributed globally
- Which countries are the happiest and least happy
- How factors like wealth, freedom, and corruption affect happiness
- Trends over time and geographical patterns

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and clean the dataset to handle missing values and standardize column names
- Visualize the distribution of happiness scores
- Compare top and bottom countries
- Analyze correlations with key indicators
- Explore trends over multiple years
- Plot global happiness on an interactive map
- Apply clustering to group countries with similar profiles
- Build an animated map and an interactive country dashboard
